**Drew Ross | IT FDN 130 A | Assignment Document**

#### 1) Explain when you would use a SQL UDF. ####
A UDF is handy when you have some input argument to pass through into the function.  In our homework we used a UDF to specify a single KPI value into the `WHERE` statement so that the function would show that specific KPI only.
#### 2) Explain are the differences between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions. ####
